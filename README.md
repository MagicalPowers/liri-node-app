# liri-node-app
A command line node application that takes in written language from a user and gives back tailored results.

### Organization
This node.js app uses a switch function to take a command line argument as a command, one of four options. The options allow the user to search for concerts, movies, and music using user-provided search terms.

### How-to operate
After cloning the repository, npm install to load all required third-party software. Following installation the user can initiate the program by entering "node liri.js " + (a command) + (a request). 
The command can only be one of four: "spotify-this", "concert-this", "spotify-this-song", and "do-what-it-says". An inappropriate command will result in an error message.
The request should be pertinent to the command i.e. the name of a song, name of a band, or name of a movie.
Relevant results will then be console logged to display to the user.

### Proof Positive
