# liri-node-app
A command line node application that takes in language and gives back tailored results

### include screenshots, a GIF, and/or a video showing us that you have the app working with no bugs

In order to meet the Employer Competitive standards and be ready to show your application to employers, the `README.md` file should meet the following criteria:

1. Clearly state the problem the app is trying to solve (i.e. what is it doing and why)
2. Give a high-level overview of how the app is organized
3. Give start-to-finish instructions on how to run the app
4. Include screenshots, gifs or videos of the app functioning
5. Contain a link to a deployed version of the app
6. Clearly list the technologies used in the app
7. State your role in the app development

Because screenshots (and well-written READMEs) are extremely important in the context of GitHub, this will be part of the grading in this assignment.
